    "# Assignment 2\n",
    "This assignment consists of two notebook files. Each exercise is graded using *hidden* tests. If you pass these tests then you are rewarded *full points* for that exercise; if your code fails the tests in any way then you will get *no points* for that exercise. Make sure to **read the rules** before you start the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "For this assignment the following rules apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "**General**\n",
    " * The assignment should be completed in **groups of two or three** (enroll in a group on Brightspace).\n",
    " * Any kind of intergroup discussion will be considered fraud and both the parties will be punished.\n",
    " * All code must be written intra group. All external help, with the exception of Python/library documentation and the lecture slides, will be considered fraud (including generative AI).\n",
    " * Do not use libraries that implement the assignment for you. Ask a TA if you are unsure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading**\n",
    " * Each exercise is graded using additional hidden tests. These tests will check your solution for different (unseen) inputs.\n",
    " * If the tests pass without error (warnings are allowed) then you receive full points.\n",
    " * If a test cell takes more than five minutes to complete then this is considered an error.\n",
    " * Do not make any assumptions on the input data (such as resolution) unless specified otherwise. Doing so may result in the tests failing and thus 0 points.\n",
    " * Your grade is computed as $\\frac{\\text{points}}{\\text{max\\_points}} * 9 + 1$ and will be rounded to the closest 0.1 point.\n",
    " * Submit your code to Brightspace as a zip file containing only the notebook (`*.ipynb`) files.\n",
    " * **Do not rename the notebook files**\n",
    " \n",
    "**Late Submissions**\n",
    " * Late submissions must be submitted *as soon as possible* to the \"Assignment 2 - Late Submissions\" assignment on Brightspace.\n",
    " * The following penalty will be applied: $\\text{adjusted grade} = \\text{grade} - 1 - \\lceil\\frac{\\text{minutes late}}{10}\\rceil$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    " \n",
    "**Before you submit**, make sure that you are not accidentaly using any global variables. Restart the kernel (wiping all global variables) and run the code from top to bottom by clicking \"Kernel\" => \"Restart & Run all\" in the menu bar at the top."

    "# Image Sharpening\n",
    "In this set of exercises we will create an image sharpening filter. Image sharpening is the opposite of blurring (which we as last week): the filter takes a (slightly) blurry image and makes it sharper (less blurry). In these assignments we will implement a sharpening filter to sharpen a picture that is slightly out of focus. Another common use case for image sharpening is on televisions. By default most televisions are configured to apply a sharpening filter to make the image look crisper (sometimes to the detriment of image quality).\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- In the Poission image editing assignments we covered how image gradients characterize an image. By only changing the colors but not the gradients we were able to create a smooth transition without changing what was in the image. Gradients are thus play an important part in encoding image information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first week you learned about blur filters such as the box and Gaussian blur. A blur operation smooths edges which results in lower magnitude gradients (spread out over a larger area). The goal of image sharpening is to perform the opposite operation: reducing the \"blurryness\" of an image. A common application of image sharpening is in TVs and video games. Where a lower resolution image is upscaled to match the output resolution, resulting in a blurry image. -->\n",
    "\n",
    "## Images as vectors\n",
    "Last week you learned to think of images as a 2D (grayscale) or 3D (color) array of values. This week we will use only vector (1D) representations for both types of images. The idea is to store all pixels  (and color channels) in an image as a vector for computation. After the computation we convert the vector back into a 2D/3D array representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different possible ways to convert an image into a vector. None of them are necessarily incorrect as long as we adjust our computations accordingly. However, because of the way the grading/testing system works we will use one specific way of converting to/from a vector representation: from top to bottom, and left to right.\n",
